### Yanni Speron

<!--My name is Yanni Speron, I am a junior undergraduate computer science major at the University of Illinois at Chicago. For the past year, I worked as a full-time Junior Associate Software Engineer at NetherRealm Studios alongside attending Michigan State University full time. Though I was able to get very valuable industry experience fixing bugs and adding features to a massive C++ codebase, I've decided to focus on my education this upcoming year and furthering my skills through hobby projects. I plan to learn Kotlin and Objective C as well as further my skills in C, C++, C#, Swift, Java, JavaScript, and Python in my free time.
